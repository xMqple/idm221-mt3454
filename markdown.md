# **About Me**
## Story

My name is Maple Tieu and I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. Being surrounded by technology at an early age, I developed a fascination with technology and the future of it. I am a student at Drexel and recently transferred into majoring in UXID. I was originally a Computer Science major, but felt that it was too restricting and I was not to have the freedom to design. I still wanted to be able to code and have discovered UXID and thought that it was perfect for me. I am able to touch on my creative side as well as my technical skills.

## Interests
My interests are UI and UX design and trying to learn more of those techniques and understanding what makes a website easy to navigate or looks nice. I also am interested in coding and learning more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to successfully design websites and applications.

## Cambodian Association of Greater Philadelphia
### **About**
The Cambodian Association of Greater Philadelphia (CAGP) is an organization that strives to improve quality of life for many Cambodian-Americans through direct service, advocacy and cultural education. They provide many programs such as school programs, case management, and preschool. They often communicate with immigrants with their native languages to provide information on what benefits they can receive in America.

### **What Did I Do?**
During my 2 months working with CAGP, I have made various brochures to advocate for their programs like for their summer school program, their organization as a whole, and their preschool program. I also organized their case files for their grants and utilized salesforce. I also helped chaperon and feed children from the school program.

### **What Did I Learn?**
What I had learned from working with CAGP was how many people in my community as a southeast Asian, are not exposed or aware of the amount of benefits they can receive from the government, because they often do not know English. I want to be able to help my community and spread more awareness on the issues that Asian-Americans face.

## **Dremulator**
### **About**
This is a project I did in Comp & Informatics II-III (6 months) with my 3 other group members. Me and my groupmates designed a game called Dremulator on GameMaker Studios 2, a game where you are a Drexel student named Drem, trying to pass their classes. There are in-game mechanics that include combat with enemies on your way to classes. The professors are known as “bosses” in which you would battle it out, determining if you pass or not! 

### **Why?**
We wanted a way for people to experience what it was like to be a Drexel student, the harsh realities of school in the form of a video game. As a commuter, we wanted to show the realities of what it was like taking SEPTA, players are able to commute to school by subway and encounter “Septa freaks” in which the player would have to combat against.

### **Contributions**
Some of the contributions I made were:
* I worked as part of the backend and the frontend developer for this project, contributing to the mechanics and the design aspect of the game. I programmed the movement system for the game and a camera that follows the player around when moving to a further part of the screen.
* I also produced a functioning health bar for the player and the enemies and the in-game battle mechanics, for example in the battle with the professor, you are brought to the screen, like a turn based battle system.
* I did some of the pixel art in the game like the furniture in Drem’s room and the floor tiles to have a visually pleasing game.

### **Team Process**
We used the Agile methodology to maintain and organize our work system, kanban boards as a way to organize our tasks and gitlab to version control. We were able to set up weekly meetings every Thursday to discuss what task we are doing for the week, making sure everyone was able to contribute to the project. We also value communication and actively used discord as a way to primarily communicate with each other to produce a minimum viable product.
