                    <p> 
                        This is a project I did in Comp & Informatics II-III (6 months) with my 3 other group members. 
                        Me and my groupmates designed a game called Dremulator on GameMaker Studios 2, a game where you are a Drexel student named Drem, trying to pass their classes. 
                        There are in-game mechanics that include combat with enemies on your way to classes. 
                        The professors are known as “bosses” in which you would battle it out, determining if you pass or not!
                    </p>

                <h2> Why? </h2>
                    <p>
                        We wanted a way for people to experience what it was like to be a Drexel student, the harsh realities of school in the form of a video game. 
                        As a commuter, we wanted to show the realities of what it was like taking SEPTA, players are able to commute to school by subway and encounter 
                        “Septa freaks” in which the player would have to combat against.

                            I worked as part of the backend and the frontend developer for this project, 
                            contributing to the mechanics and the design aspect of the game. 
                            I programmed the movement system for the game and a camera that follows the player 
                            around when moving to a further part of the screen.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I also produced a functioning health bar for the player and the enemies and the in-game 
                            battle mechanics, for example in the battle with the professor, you are brought to the screen, 
                            like a turn based battle system.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I did some of the pixel art in the game like the furniture in Drem’s room and the floor tiles 
                            to have a visually pleasing game.
                        </li>
