                    <h2> About </h2>
                        <p> 
                            Paris Baguette is a Korean owned franchise that specializes in French pastries and desserts. 
                            They try to achieve visually appealing pastries that capture the attention of many customers.
                        </p>
                    <h2> What Did I Do? </h2>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my 7 months working with them, I was able to learn how to communicate well with customers 
                            and their needs. I managed to maintain a clean workspace and make a variety of drinks that we offer. 
                            I packed numerous bread and pastries for customers and made sure the customers were satisfied with the service.
                        </p>
                    <h2> What Did I Learn? </h2>
                        <p>
                            What I had learned from my experience at Paris Baguette was the importance of communication and teamwork with others. 
                            Communicating with customers and with my co-workers each shift, I learned that communication is key to building 
                            relationships and sharing experiences. It helps productivity within a workspace and drives for better results.
                        </p>
