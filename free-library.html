                <h2> About </h2>
                    <p> 
                        The Free Library of Philadelphia comprises many Libraries throughout 
                        Philadelphia, often having events and school programs for children to 
                        attend. They advocate for students who are from low income families that 
                        cannot afford paid school programs, but want a way for their children to actively 
                        learn outside of school.
                    </p>

                <h2> What Did I Do? </h2>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my 3 years of working with them, I have been able to help 
                        children with their homework and be able to facilitate educational activities 
                        like building circuits, to help children engage in critical thinking. I also facilitated 
                        activities with arts and crafts, helping many children with expanding their creative sides.
                    </p>
                <h2> What Did I Learn? </h2>
                    <p>
                        What I had learned from working with the Free Library of Philadelphia was the importance 
                        of education and helping others in need. Education is a right everyone should have and being 
                        able to engage in meaningful and educational activities have made me value education.
