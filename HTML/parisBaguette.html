                <h2> What Did I Do? </h2>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my 7 months working with them, I was able to learn how to communicate well with customers 
                        and their needs. I managed to maintain a clean workspace and make a variety of drinks that we offer. 
                        I packed numerous bread and pastries for customers and made sure the customers were satisfied with the service.

                <h2> What Did I Learn? </h2>
                    <p>
                        What I had learned from my experience at Paris Baguette was the importance of communication and teamwork with others. 
                        Communicating with customers and with my co-workers each shift, I learned that communication is key to building 
                        relationships and sharing experiences. It helps productivity within a workspace and drives for better results.
