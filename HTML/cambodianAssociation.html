                    <p> 
                        The Cambodian Association of Greater Philadelphia (CAGP) is an organization 
                        that strives to improve quality of life for many Cambodian-Americans through 
                        direct service, advocacy and cultural education. They provide many programs 
                        such as school programs, case management, and preschool. They often communicate 
                        with immigrants with their native languages to provide information on what benefits 
                        they can receive in America.

                <h2> What Did I Do? </h2>
                    <p>
                        During my 2 months working with CAGP, I have made various brochures to advocate for their 
                        programs like for their summer school program, their organization as a whole, and their 
                        preschool program. I also organized their case files for their grants and utilized salesforce. 
                        I also helped chaperon and feed children from the school program.

                <h2> What Did I Learn? </h2>
                    <p>
                        What I had learned from working with CAGP was how many people in my community as a southeast 
                        Asian, are not exposed or aware of the amount of benefits they can receive from the government, 
                        because they often do not know English. I want to be able to help my community and spread more 
                        awareness on the issues that Asian-Americans face.
